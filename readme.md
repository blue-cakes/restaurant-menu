# restaurant-menu
A basic HTML/CSS project for **beginners**. You can fork and choose to make it more complex if you wish.
***
## elements used in this project.
The elements I'm going to be using in the HTML file;
+ **A `h1` header saying the name of the restaurant**
+ **`h2` headers saying _price_, _name_, _serial _number_ and for platters, _contains:_.**
+ **`h3` headers for serial numbers`**
+ **An opening paragraph about the restaurant**
+ **And descriptions of the food in small font below the name**
 ***
The more _complex_ CSS elements I'm going to be using
+ **`div` and `span`**
+ **`padding` and `margin`**
+ **`text-decoration`**
